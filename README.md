## Summary :

- There is high amount of people participating in the bike sharing service, especially in different specific timeline. Mostly male is taking part in riding bike. People might use it to go to work on weekdays to replace the personal vehicle, and for exercise on weekend. 

- Two recommendation for bike-sharing:

  * We should visualize the weather to examine if it affects people going on a bike.
  * We might examine which route that people are likely to bike, especially on the weekend, so that we will determine where the bike sharing service will be located.
